# [Smart Contract Development]

What a great hands-on book by Kevin Solorio, Randall Kanna,
and David H. Hoover.

## Ethereum Client

I'm experimenting [OpenEthereum].  It's deprecated but trying
it, because it's written in [Rust]. :)

I'm building it from the source, as explained in the
[OpenEthereum github page].
